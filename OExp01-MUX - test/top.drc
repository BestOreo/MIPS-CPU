WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_29/XLXI_1/_n0116 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   XLXI_24/addr_bus[31]_GND_12_o_AND_2163_o11 is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   XLXI_24/addr_bus[31]_addr_bus[31]_AND_2195_o is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading
   of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_24/_n0257 is sourced

   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_29/XLXN_11<0> is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
